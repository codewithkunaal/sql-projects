shoutout to u/stiffupperleg for incredible idea 
basically in this project ive imported a dictionary in csv format converted to sql file
then i ran some basic queries without cleaning it "genius"
so the first file will have all the basic queries that i can think of 
in the 2nd file i will run complex queries
